# Airplane-Accident-Severity-Prediction
A Machine Learning model for Airplane Accident Severity Prediction

This repository contains a Machine Learning Model for the topic of Airplane Accident Severity Prediction.

The dataset contains 11 features and 10,000 instances.

This project was built as part of a Hackerearth Hackathon. 

The model is a stacking ensemble of Base Classifiers Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Neural Networks and Ensemble Classifier as Logistic Regression. Furthermore, the model includes the famous technique of Particle Swarm Optimization for finding the optimal values of the 'C' and 'gamma' parameters for SVM.
